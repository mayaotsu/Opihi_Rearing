-Looking at Survival in the first 5-6 hpf.

-Embryos were put into temperature treatments and checked 6 hours later. End of experiment. 

-I had three trials and 5 temperature treatments. Although, 17.5 and 31C were only in one trial. 

-Each temp had 3 replicate vials (for each trial). EX: Temperature 25C had a total of 9 vials but 17.5 only had 3 vials. 

-Each trial was with one female. 

-Note: Temp 31C, all vials had 0 survivors leading to quasi complete separation? (idk I googled it)
